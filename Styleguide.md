# English writing style guide

## Style

* [American English](http://www.thewriter.com/what-we-think/style-guide/british-vs-american-english/).
* Always use sentence casing, even in headings.
* [Singular they](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_they).
* Use contractions: it’s, we’ll.
* Ellipses in quotations: […].
* Spell out numbers from one to ten: 2 times → two times.
* Use Arabic numerals for centuries: 19th century.
* No smileys and emojis in articles. 
* Smiley always has a nose: :-)
* Avoid unnecessary abbreviations:
    * “e.g.” → “for example”;
    * “i.e.” → “that is”;
    * “N.B.” → “note that”;
    * “a.k.a.” → also known as;
    * PR → pull request;
    * POV → point of view.
* Avoid “etc.”, start lists with “like” instead: “Dwarves eats food like stone bread, chuf and dirsek.”
* Put punctuation within quotations: ‘“stone bread,” “chuf,” and “dirsek.”‘
* Avoid brackets.
* Use correct “quotes”, an ampersand’ and an em dash —.

## Formatting

* Write filenames in bold: **package.json**.
* Do not start terminal commands with `$`.
* Lists items are formatted either as a part of a sentence (`Foo:\n * bar;\n * baz.`) or as independent sentences (`Foo:\n * Bar.\n * Baz.`).
